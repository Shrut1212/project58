            <p> I am Shrut Jain,  a very big fan of sports and exercise. People think that sports is boring and exercise is tiring. But they dont know how fun it is to play sports like Cricket, Basketball, Football and so on. They dont know this becuase they never try it!<br/><br/> Some children want to become sports stars like Virat Kohli, Cristiano Ronaldo, Michael Jordan and Many more. But they dont wanna exercise at all and become lazy. The key component to become a sports star is to exercise! Without this the superstars of today would never exist. It is advicable to all people in the world to exercise as exercise protects us from various and dangerous diseases. This is the main reason why playing sports and exercising is my most favourite hobby! So remember - 
                BE FIT, EAT FIT
